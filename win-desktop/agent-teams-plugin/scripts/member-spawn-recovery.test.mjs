/**
 * `dsh-web-app` and the Agent Teams profile layer ship `tool-subagent` and
 * `tool-subagent-control` disabled, so `subagent` and `send_message` are absent from the
 * registry. The host applies a member's `toolFilter` through a strict `tools.restrict()`
 * that rejects an unregistered name instead of ignoring it. That rejection used to abort
 * every member start, leaving every member of every team `unspawned` with no visible reason.
 *
 * `memberToolFilter` resolves the depth entries against the host's registry view, which
 * covers the compositions that expose one. This pins the recovery path underneath it for
 * everything that resolution cannot see — no registry view, a name that is known but not
 * restrictable, a mounting difference — and it reproduces the host message shape verbatim
 * so the contract stays pinned to it:
 * `tools.restrict() names unknown global tool "x"; known global tools: …`.
