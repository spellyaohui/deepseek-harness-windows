/**
 * Models-page extension slots — the two seats through which a plugin
 * distributed outside this repository adds UI to the Models settings section
 * without editing it.
 *
 * `settings.models.provider-card` is keyed by the row's owning settings
 * namespace (`ProviderDirectoryEntry.settingsNs`): an adapter family's
 * companion plugin registers one entry under the family's namespace and
 * receives every card of that family — shipped, added, and hand-declared rows
 * alike — while the section never learns what the namespace means. Keying on
 * the namespace follows `settings.plugin.item`, and the key domain stays the
 * open string space because hand-declared route ids are user-chosen at
 * runtime.
 *
 * TYPE HOME RATIONALE: the Models section declares these slots at runtime,
 * and a plugin registering an extension already depends on this package for
 * the declaration. The types therefore live with their declarer.
